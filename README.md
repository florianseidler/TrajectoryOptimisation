# TrajectoryOptimisation
Goal: 
Trajectory optimisation by using an nlp solver

Trajectory optimization like Matthew Kelly:
- Define cost function, start- end constraints etc., collocation and conversion to equality and inequality constraints.

Interior point method nlp solver like Joel Kaardal:
- function, equality and inequality constraints as input to find minimum/maximum function values
