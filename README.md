# TrajectoryOptimisation
Goal: Trajectory optimization by using an nlp solver
Trajectory optimization like Matthew Peter Kelly:
- Define cost function, start- end constraints etc., collocation and conversion to equality and inequality constraints.
Interior point method nlp solver like Joel Kaardal:
- function, equality and inequality constraints as input to find minimum/maximum function values
